== What is Quails

This is an application for keeping track of birdwatching activities and presenting them to the world. It allows to
store, analyze, review, and filter observation records, place them on the map, attach images, generate life-, year-,
month- and other checklists, and of course blog about birds and birding.

== Why Quails

Quails is a collective name for several groups of mid-sized hen-like birds. The reference species is Old World
Common Quail <i>Coturnix coturnix</i>. In addition 'quails' sounds very close to 'rails'.

Actually 'rails' are birds as well - members of the _Rallidae_ family associated mostly with wetlands. So I could have
named my application Rails but decided it could inspire confusion in the Ruby open source world.

== Dependencies

[Ruby 2.0] Ruby 2.0.0 is used for both production and development. May also work on 1.9.3, but not guaranteed.
[PostgreSQL] Some queries may be PostgreSQL-specific. PostgreSQL 9.1 is used.
