  # 1. This is mostly used when promoting ebird taxon to taxon (and further to species)
  # 2. But it also can be called separately to create a species after taxon category is
  # manually changed to species (like Motacilla feldegg).
  # 3. It also contains additional logic to fix an existing species relation after taxonomy update,
  # when lump or split occurred:
  #     a. Lump: Species is linked to a nominative subspecies(taxon-issf) that was formerly a species. It should be
  #        relinked to a newly promoted taxon-species (superspecies), and also to its children (who are the
  #        lumped taxa).
  #     b. Split: Species is linked to a slash or spuh taxon that was formerly a (super)species. It should be relinked
  #        to a newly promoted or existing nominative taxon-species (that was formerly a taxon-subspecies)
